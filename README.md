# Text to Speech Video Sample
Currently in its infancy, this project is based on the software created by (*[check it out](https://github.com/alexram1313/text-to-speech-sample)*) written by [Alex I. Ramirez](https://github.com/alexram1313), and led by Subhashish Panigrahi.

This is the sample project from my Text-to-Speech tutorial on YouTube. The included dictionary is from the Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science Department, although I removed a version of "deja" that contained non-ASCII characters which would raise an error (There is a way to properly handle it though). Additionally, not all the speech sounds have been included.
